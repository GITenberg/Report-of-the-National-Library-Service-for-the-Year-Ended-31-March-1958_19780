<p class="right-indent">Wellington, 16 July 1958.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have the honour to submit the following report of the activities of
the National Library Service. The report covers the work of the Service
as a whole and its four divisions&mdash;Country Library Service, School
Library Service, Library School, and National Library Centre.</p>

<p>The functions of the Service may be summed up as the provision of
such assistance to any New Zealand library maintained directly or indirectly
from public funds as circumstances and policy permit. More
specifically, help is given by a lending service to rural, borough, and
county libraries, by the provision of books for school libraries, by advancing
professional training through the Library School, and by maintenance
of records of all library holdings of books and periodicals, as well as other
facilities and stock to aid the cooperative use of this material.</p>

<p>The National Library Service was formed in 1945 from the Country
Library Service by Cabinet decision with the strong support of the New
Zealand Library Association. During the war the Country Library
Service had been given responsibility for several tasks of national scope,
such as the War Library Service, the Central Bureau for Library Book
Imports, the formation of a Union Catalogue, and the operation of
part of the inter-library loan scheme.</p>

<p>The Country Library Service, which began in 1938, has maintained
its van services to rural areas and has been brought into closer contact
with its districts by decentralisation to three district offices&mdash;Christchurch
in 1944, Palmerston North in 1948, and Hamilton in 1953.</p>

<p>The number of free libraries regularly receiving service has grown to
112. Special assistance in a number of cases has been given to libraries
serving a population of up to 50,000 operating a free and rental service.
The assistance given to the Gisborne and Wanganui Public Libraries has
continued. New Plymouth Public Library which changed to free service
in November 1957, and Palmerston North Public Library, which is
expanding its service, have also received assistance. The fundamental
principle of encouraging full local responsibility for adequate rate-supported
libraries has continued.</p>

<p>The School Library Service has continued to bring a wide range and
variety of books to school children, the rate of issue now exceeding
one million copies annually. Distribution is effected through 15 centres.</p>

<p>During the year this Service received three valuable sets of books
chosen to represent all phases of American life and thought. The
Carnegie Corporation of New York made these sets available to some
26 libraries in New Zealand.</p>

<p><i><a name="Scientific_Technical_and_Commercial_Library_Service" id="Scientific_Technical_and_Commercial_Library_Service"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Scientific, Technical, and Commercial Library Service</a></i>&mdash;A recommendation
has been made by the New Zealand Library Association that
impetus be given to scientific and technical library service, chiefly through
public libraries. At a time when increasing reliance is being placed on
the efficiency of our secondary industry the necessity of providing the
fullest technical information to aid manufacturers will be apparent.
Authority was obtained 12 years ago to establish such a service but
it was not then possible to obtain qualified persons to begin it. It is
hoped that conditions will permit a senior appointment during the
present financial year to inaugurate the service.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_4" id ="Page_4" title="4"></a><i><a name="Regional_and_District_Library_Service" id="Regional_and_District_Library_Service"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Regional and District Library Service</a></i>&mdash;Study has continued on the
problems of ensuring an efficient and soundly based library service for
New Zealand's whole population. The problems facing a local authority
overseas with a population of 2,000,000 within a radius of a few miles
are minor ones compared with those facing New Zealand library
authorities, where the secondary cities are small, where the pattern of
local government is uneven, and where the population as a whole has
a high standard of education and is avid for books. Costs in New
Zealand, per head of population, are bound to be relatively high;
vigilance is necessary to ensure that they are no higher than they need be.</p>

<p>It has been apparent that cooperation between local authorities will
be the major factor in making economies on a national scale. A note of
the work of the Working Party on Library Cooperation of 27-28 August
1956 appeared in last year's annual report, and it was recorded that the
Minister of Education, at the request of the New Zealand Library
Association, had authorised payment of travelling expenses for its Committee
on Regional Planning to enable its work to be carried out.</p>

<p>The committee worked during the year and met in Wellington for two
full-day sessions on 6 and 7 June 1957 for consideration of the "establishment
of regional and district library services as the best method of
providing a more effective library service for the whole country". Its
report was made to the New Zealand Library Association. After
consideration by the executive of the Local Authorities Section, some
amendments were made and the report published by the Association
as <i>Co-operation: A New Phase</i>. Fifteen hundred copies were printed and
were circulated to all local authorities for discussion.</p>

<p>The report states:</p>

<p>"1. The main problems facing public libraries are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(i) The unfair distribution over the whole community of
the costs of library service.</p>

<p>(ii) The continuing growth of the cost of municipal government
to the point where it has become an embarrassment to
the cities and boroughs concerned.</p>

<p>(iii) The failure of some local authorities to provide for
library services."</p></div>

<p>"8. The basic factor in improving library services will be cooperation
among local authorities. Such cooperation should be the condition of
increased Government assistance."</p>

<p>"10. Government assistance to such federations should take the form
of cash subsidies on all expenditure approved for subsidy by the federation,
and by the Minister (or National Library Board)."</p>

<p>This report formed the main topic of discussion at the New Zealand
Library Association conference in Invercargill in February 1958. The
Association approached the Government for favourable consideration of
the proposals contained in the report on 11 April 1958.</p>

<p>In the meantime the work of the Royal Commission on Local
Government Finance is being followed carefully, as its findings will
have considerable bearing on the problem of library finance.</p>

<p>An effort is also being made to foster among local authorities the
willingness to cooperate, but progress in this field is slow.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_5" id ="Page_5" title="5"></a><i><a name="National_Library_Proposal" id="National_Library_Proposal"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">National Library Proposal</a></i>&mdash;The report of the Working Party of the
Public Service Commission on the National Library proposal was
earlier considered by the Government, which had approved it in
principle. The House of Representatives last year approved the terms
of reference of a Select Committee to be appointed to make recommendations
for "ways and means of carrying out the decision of the
Government to establish a National Library" and to consider various
other associated matters. The decision to appoint such a Committee
was reaffirmed in February 1958, the Committee was named shortly
afterwards and has since met on several occasions. Independently of
any solution of the accommodation problems of the Service which such
a move might bring, the proposal merits the most careful consideration.</p>

<p><i><a name="Book_Stock" id="Book_Stock"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Book Stock</a></i>&mdash;During the year, 19,283 fiction and 35,573 non-fiction
were added to stock, a total of 54,856. Of these, 10,442 separate titles
of non-fiction and 205 fiction titles were added to the headquarters
collection, which now contains approximately 135,000 titles together
with 11,000 volumes of periodicals; 15,305 volumes were withdrawn&mdash;12,134
fiction and 3,171 non-fiction&mdash;making the net additions 39,551.
The total of headquarters and Country Library Service stock now
amounts to 652,308, comprising 176,600 fiction and 475,708 non-fiction.
As at 31 March 1958 the stock of the School Library Service was
1,091,189 the grand total of stock in the Service as a whole being
1,743,497.</p>

<p><i><a name="Request_Service" id="Request_Service"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Request Service</a></i>&mdash;All libraries and groups receiving library service from
the Country Library Service and all Government Departments may ask
for special short-term loans of books of an informational type from the
headquarters stock of this Service and, in addition, the headquarters
stock is used extensively to satisfy inter-library loan requests. (See also
the report of the Librarian, National Library Centre.)</p>

<p>On 31 March 1958, 989 towns and small centres were receiving regular
loans of books, an increase of 32 centres over the previous year. In
addition, 54 Ministry of Works, State Hydro-electric, and New Zealand
Forest Service camps and stations were given library service. Books are
also on loan to six places in the Chatham Islands, and to Niue, Rarotonga,
and Pitcairn Island. Free loans of books on a population basis
are given to mental hospitals and prisons situated both in country and
urban districts.</p>

<p>Books, periodicals, and information are available to country people
in the following ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<dl><dt>(a)</dt><dd>Free loans of books on a population basis to libraries controlled by
the local authorities, which in turn agree to make their libraries

</div>

<p>All libraries served under (a) and (b) and the majority under (c)
receive regular visits from one of the especially equipped book vans
of this Service; at least three visits being paid to each library during
a normal year. In addition, all persons, by whichever of the above
means they receive library service, may obtain loans of requested books
by post.</p>

<p>These libraries served an estimated local population of 437,000, with
a considerable number in surrounding areas. Besides the many requested
books and periodicals 91,954 books are on regular loan to them.</p>

<p>By arrangement with the Waitemata, Patangata, Egmont, and Rangitikei
County Councils the public libraries at Titirangi, Otane, Opunake,
and Bulls respectively receive a free service.<a class="page" name="Page_7" id ="Page_7" title="7"></a></p>

<p>Library buildings continue to improve. During the year new libraries
were opened in Geraldine, Greymouth, New Lynn, and Morrinsville,
and new buildings are planned in several other centres. This Service
continues to assist in making available material on good overseas
practice and New Zealand achievement. Assistance is also given in the
design of the interiors of libraries and in specifications for equipment.</p>

<p>The best results are achieved when a local authority and the librarian
prepare a written building programme, specifying the functions of the
library, the various areas to be provided, the relationship between each,
the number of books, readers, and librarians to be accommodated, and
the equipment to be housed for efficient service. Such a document gives
a clear directive to the architect, but at the same time allows him complete
freedom of expression in designing the building.</p>

<p>The shortage of trained librarians continues. Three students from
the 1957 Library School professional course accepted positions in public
libraries serving centres of under 20,000 population, but they were all
replacements for qualified librarians who had taken library work in
other fields, so there was no net gain. There was at least one public
library in a small town unable to fill its vacancy for a qualified
librarian.</p>

<p>The short course for librarians from smaller centres, held at the
Library School from 12 to 30 August 1957, was of great value to the
participating librarians. The demand for training is very great and,
with such eagerness to learn, the training given is immediately effective.</p>

<p>Cooperation between libraries participating in the Country Library
Service has been developing slowly. A little more interest has been shown
in the cooperative book-buying scheme fostered by this Service. There
are now 22 libraries taking part. Libraries working together in this way
for the first time this year are Blenheim, Cambridge, Kaikoura, Morrinsville,
Picton, Putaruru, and Te Kuiti.</p>

<p>Assistance in staffing was given to the public libraries at Morrinsville
and Picton for reorganisation and extension of local services. Field
librarians continue to advise and assist on their regular visits.</p>

<p>A collection of 300 books was lent to the New Zealand IGY party at
Scott Base, Ross Dependency, as had been done in the case of the New
Zealand Antarctic Expedition a year earlier.</p>

<p>During the year ministerial approval was given for provision of a
full-time librarian and complete service to be granted to the library at
the new Benmore camp, subject to the Ministry of Works providing a
satisfactory building.</p>

<p><i><a name="Book_Van" id="Book_Van"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Book Van</a></i>&mdash;During the year one of three book vans operating in the
South Island was replaced. Using experience gained in recent replacements
in the North Island the new van is constructed of aluminium
alloy on a four-ton, long-wheel-base chassis. Particular care was taken
in providing good sealing against dust and water, adequate natural
lighting, and the best possible insulation.</p>

<p>Excellent insulation is achieved by a thick layer of expanded polystyrene
on all sides, roof, and floor. Very efficient lighting without
excessive heat problems has been provided by the installation of two
large roof lights of double glazed, toughened, anti-sun polished plate,
the upper light being held an inch above the roof line with a free flow
of air between the panes. This form of construction has contributed
to the good handling qualities of the van. Approximately 2,000 books
are carried.<a class="page" name="Page_8" id ="Page_8" title="8"></a></p>

<p><i><a name="Minimum_Standards_for_Public_Libraries_Participating_in_the_Country_Library_Service" id="Minimum_Standards_for_Public_Libraries_Participating_in_the_Country_Library_Service"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Minimum Standards for Public Libraries Participating in the Country
Library Service</a></i>&mdash;Overseas, most national and State organisations consider
it their responsibility to publish statements of standard library practice,
and codes for its evaluation. The most important statement is <i>Public
Library Service: A Guide to Evaluation, with Minimum Standards</i>, which
was approved by the Council of the American Library Association and
published by the Association in Chicago in 1956.</p>

<p>In 1952 the New Zealand Library Association Standards Research
Committee prepared its "Basic Standards for New Zealand Libraries,
1952", which was published in <i>New Zealand Libraries 15</i>:121-131;
145-150, Jl-Ag, S '52. This was based on the survey attempted by the
visiting American librarian, Miss Miriam Tompkins, in 1950, but was
not a formal pronouncement of the Association.</p>

<p>For the Country Library Service the problem has been present since
1938. Assistance to local authorities has been given on three conditions,
approved by the Minister of Education at the inception of the Service.
The third of these conditions is that the "local authority should maintain
the library at a reasonable standard of service".</p>

<p>Country Library Service assistance to libraries has always been
planned as service to assist local effort, not to supplant it. Where the
local service does not reach a certain standard a certain proportion of
the Country Library Service assistance loses its force. No matter how
much the assistance is increased the local people cannot benefit fully
from it unless the local authority houses it in a fair building, grafts it
on to a reasonable local book collection, and has the whole serviced
by an active and informed librarian. Continuity of good service is
assured only when the basic objectives of library service are enunciated
and clearly understood by the local authority.</p>

<p>Local authorities have not abused the flexible interpretation given to
the "reasonable standard of service" condition, but have appreciated the
fact that the Country Library Service always took into consideration
any local difficulties that existed. Libraries generously supported by
their local authorities without exception have made full use of all the
services the Government has offered, and the local people have benefited
from a first-class library service in its fullest cultural and educational
sense.</p>

<p>Local provision has naturally varied, but since 1950 the pattern of
local achievement has become more apparent, and the possibility was
seen of drawing up some code for evaluation. Local authorities participating
in this service were consulted and agreed to provide statistical
notes on their own work. These data formed the basis of a draft statement
which set out standards under headings of functions, service, staff, books,
and buildings, and which was sent to local authorities for comment. It
was gratifying to receive replies from so many, saying that they would
consider such a statement quite fair and reasonable. Accordingly, the
"Minimum Standards for Public Libraries Participating in the Country
Library Service" was approved by the Minister of Education on 22 April
1958 and issued formally.</p>

<p>The document emphasises that it gives standards for minimum provision,
and that local authorities aiming to give good service will not
be satisfied until they are exceeded. That they are exceeded in several
centres is a matter for congratulation, and the local authorities concerned
have reason to be proud of their libraries, and are in every case anxious
to maintain their good record.</p>

<p>During the year, 832 of these libraries were linked with this Service,
compared with 801 for the previous year. Of these libraries, 253 are
served from Hamilton, 191 from Palmerston North, and 388 from
Christchurch.</p>

<p>Altogether 75,997 books were on loan to the 832 libraries, an average
of over 91 books per library. Over the past 10 years the average for each
library has increased from 79 books, or 15 per cent, thus demonstrating
the increasing interest that country readers are taking in the type of
books supplied by this Service. The figures shown as basic issues do not
include the thousands of books loaned to these libraries on short term

<p>In places where no library exists and where it is not possible for one
to be formed and visited by a book van, a service to properly established
groups by means of hampers is provided. During the year 45 of these
groups received service, there being 3,325 books on regular loan to them.
The hamper service is also extended to six places in the Chatham Islands
and to Pitcairn Island.</p>

During the year a total of 1,851 books was issued, mostly by a hamper
service.</p>

<p>During the year 54 camps or stations received visits from the book

<p>Visits have continued from the book vans to 12 general hospitals with
an exchange of 1,405 books. Twelve mental hospitals received 3,910
books and 13 prisons 3,125 books. During the year assistance has been
given to the Department of Justice in book and periodical selection.</p>

<p>Difficulties occur from time to time in connection with the service
to prisons and mental hospitals. They arise from the lack of supervision
of these libraries by trained library staff. Officers engaged in other duties
are not in a position to organise the full service which would be of such
benefit to patients and prisoners.</p>

<p>From the special TB collection 1,620 books were exchanged at four-monthly
intervals for 15 sanatoria and tuberculosis wards of public
hospitals. Three hundred and thirteen books were sent on request (250
non-fiction and 63 fiction). Sixty-four requests could not be fulfilled
as the required books were not available through the stock or through
purchase, and the resources of other collections are not used for these
borrowers.<a class="page" name="Page_10" id ="Page_10" title="10"></a></p>

<p>In 1941 the Minister of Education approved the establishment of a
New Zealand School Library Service, the purchasing of books to be
financed from the augmented item "School and Class Libraries" in
the vote "Education", the administration being undertaken by the
Country Library Service, as it then was. This new service was to provide
not school text books, but a wide and varied choice of books of high
imaginative quality or technical excellence, suitable for children at all
levels of ability and stages of development. The smaller and more remote
country schools were to be given priority. Books were to be freely
available for reading at home.</p>

<p>The provision of supplies of books which circulate among schools goes
some way towards setting free the money for library books, available to
schools by way of annual capitation grant and from local contribution,
which is eligible for subsidy. These funds may then be used to build
at each school (a) a collection of such basic reference books as are
needed always at hand; (b) reading material for the preparatory classes;
(c) books of purely local interest; (d) other books which it is desired
to have permanently.</p>

<p>By cooperation between the Education Board and the Dunedin City
Council considerable progress had been made in service to schools in
Otago since 1938. Vigorous exploitation of a book stock selected in
terms of children's interests followed the most enlightened overseas
practice, linking skilfully the activities of home, school, and public
library, as well as introducing to this country books not previously
known here.</p>

<p>Beginning in Canterbury in March 1942 by incorporating the Travelling
Library for Rural Schools, the School Library Service has developed
until, today, exchanges of books are sent to 2,490 schools with a total
roll (excluding primers) of 298,317. These figures do not include those
for post-primary schools, which make use of the information and
request service only.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_11" id ="Page_11" title="11"></a>Services available to schools and to the <a name="smaller_public_libraries" id="smaller_public_libraries"></a>smaller public libraries can be
broadly defined as general exchanges of books, information and request
service, provision of book lists, and advice on library planning.</p>

<p>General exchanges of books, changed regularly, are sent to all primary,
intermediate, and district high schools and the primary departments of
registered private schools which join the service, for the use of pupils
in Standard 1 and upwards. These books are intended mainly for
recreational reading, both at home and at school. The number sent in
each exchange is based on the school roll, exclusive of primer classes,
on a scale of not fewer than one per child, while for small schools it is
usually possible to increase this to two or three books per child. Exchanges
are made at least once a year, with further exchanges during the year
for smaller schools to the extent that books and staff make possible. Where
satisfactory arrangements for storage and adequate use can be made,
exchanges of suitable books are also sent to the smaller public libraries
which provide free service in their children's and young adults' sections.
The number of books sent is based on the population of the area controlled
by the local authority. Post-primary schools depending, as they
do, mainly on their own libraries, do not receive exchanges of books but
participate with the other schools in the information and request and
other services available. The post-primary departments of district high
schools are eligible for all services, including exchanges.</p>

<p>The <a name="information_and_request_service" id="information_and_request_service"></a>information and request service, available to all schools which
have joined the service, supplies to both children and teachers, on short-term
loan, books and other material to meet individual needs not satisfied
by the general exchanges. The particular aim is to meet requests for
children's books and books for school purposes. Schools have been
urged to make the fullest use of this service which helps to ensure that
the right book reaches the child who needs it, for classroom activity or
any other worth-while purpose. Material for the personal or study needs
of teachers cannot usually be supplied by the School Library Service;
such requests can, however, be handed to the nearest public library
or "B" library group linked with the Country Library Service. When
schools are establishing new libraries extra help by way of special
collections or indefinite loans is given. All public libraries and groups
receiving library service from the Country Library Service may use the
information and request service. During the year 328,482 books were
sent out in response to requests.</p>

<p>The preparation of <a name="book_lists" id="book_lists"></a>book lists, which have proved of value to schools
and public libraries has been continued this year. The supplements to
<i>Junior Fiction</i> and <i>Non-Fiction for Primary Schools</i> are annotated lists
of the better, recently published children's books, other than those
appearing in countries with which there are currency difficulties; these
supplements are distributed twice a year to schools and public libraries
which ask to be placed on a mailing list. "For the Post-primary Library",
a series of annotated lists of current titles, has been appearing regularly
in the <i>Education Gazette</i> since 16 July 1951. Public libraries and larger
post-primary schools will find further suggestions in the cyclostyled
series "Books for Young Adults" which appears at intervals; it includes
books for recreational reading and gives special consideration to suitable
adult titles. Other lists are prepared for publication as the need arises.
A bibliography of material published by the Service from its inception<a class="page" name="Page_12" id ="Page_12" title="12"></a>
in 1942 appeared in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 1956.
Since that date the following items have been added:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Books for young adults: List 5, October 1956; List 6, June 1957; List 7,

<p>Sets of books for French classes, August 1956.</p></div>

<p>In addition to this published material, buying and reading lists are
constantly being prepared to meet the special needs of individual schools,
public libraries, and groups concerned with the reading of children and
adolescents.</p>

<p>Assistance is given to schools planning new libraries or reorganising
existing libraries. The visiting of schools to give help where needed and to
discuss the use of books is still limited by staff shortages.</p>

<p>Except for small parcels which are sent by post, books are distributed
in hampers or cartons by rail or road transport from 15 centres&mdash;North
Island: Whangarei and Hastings public libraries; offices of the Country
Library Service in Hamilton and Palmerston North and of the School
Library Service in Auckland, Napier, New Plymouth, Wanganui, and
Wellington. South Island: Greymouth, Timaru, Dunedin, and Invercargill
public libraries; the office of the Country Library Service in
Christchurch and of the School Library Service in Nelson. Schools are
usually served by the nearest School Library Service office.</p>

<p>The headquarters office at Wellington is responsible for the coordination
of the service, for the selection, ordering, classifying, and
cataloguing of new books and their dispatch to district offices, the
maintenance of a comprehensive collection of children's and young
people's books used to meet requests which cannot be supplied from local
offices, and the distribution of books to schools and public libraries in
or near Wellington city and the Hutt Valley. To enable children at
smaller country schools to see and to choose for themselves from a wide
range of books, the possibilities of service by book van are being
considered.</p>

<p>Since its establishment schools joining the service have paid a subscription
at the rate of 1s. per pupil (Standard 1 and upwards) for
each of the first two years. Ministerial authority was given during the
year to discontinue this levy.</p>

<p>Schools borrowing books are asked to accept responsibility for (a) safe-keeping
of books while on loan to the school, including books issued
to members of staff for school use; (b) return of books when due; (c)
payment for books lost or damaged beyond fair wear and tear; (d) payment
of freight and postal charges from school to School Library Service
office.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_13" id ="Page_13" title="13"></a>Books are made available to special institutions controlled by the
Education Department. Primary pupils of the Correspondence School
are provided with individual postal service from district offices. Child
welfare institutions, training centres, health camps, and other special
groups are given service according to their needs. Teachers' training
colleges, young people's groups, kindergartens, and nursery play centre
supervisors are also helped. Visits to School Library Service offices by
teachers in training are arranged wherever possible.</p>

<p><a name="Assistance_to_several_Pacific_Island_schools" id="Assistance_to_several_Pacific_Island_schools"></a>Assistance to several Pacific Island schools has been continued from
the Auckland office by means of extended loans. Under this system the
schools receive an original bulk loan which they check annually, reporting
losses and returning damaged and worn books for replacement,
wherever possible, by new titles, so that loans will not degenerate into
collections of old books. The schools concerned were listed in last year's
annual report. The desirability of extension of this service is constantly
in review.</p>

<p>During the year members of the staff acted as librarians at the usual
teachers' refresher courses. Appropriate collections of books always
create considerable interest. Discussions at these courses have been helpful
in the selection of books and have brought about an increased
awareness of the uses of books in a wide range of schools.</p>

<p>Below are tables showing details of the School Library Service as at
31 March 1958. The figures for the number of "schools" and "pupils"
include those for primary schools and post-primary departments of
district high schools but do not include those for other post-primary
schools as these do not receive general exchanges of books. (Figures in

<h3>1957 PROFESSIONAL COURSE</h3>

<p>At the end of November nine diplomas and five certificates were
awarded to 14 students who completed the course. For health reasons
one student accepted under the Colombo Plan returned to his own
country at the end of the first term. Of the successful students two
returned to the libraries in which they had been employed before
attending the school, three were appointed librarians of smaller public
libraries, four joined the staffs of city public libraries, two are now
members of the School Library Service staff, and one the librarian of
the Central Military District. The two holders of UNESCO Fellowships
are consolidating their training by carrying out practical work in the
Delhi Public Library for three months.</p>

<h3>1958 PROFESSIONAL COURSE</h3>

<p>This course began on 4 March with 17 New Zealand students and the
three Indonesian students who have been working in libraries in New
Zealand since February 1957.</p>

<p>Four students have a master's and nine a bachelor's degree in arts,
one a bachelor's degree in music, and two are holders of the New Zealand
Library Association's Certificate.</p>

<h3>NEW ZEALAND LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TRAINING COURSE</h3>

<p>Part II of this course was held at the Library School from 14
January to 15 February. Twenty-two students attended and all were
recommended for the award of the Association's certificate.</p>

<h3>1957 SHORT COURSE</h3>

<p>A short course for librarians and library assistants mainly from smaller
public libraries was held from 12 to 31 August. There were 21 students
from the following public libraries: Birkenhead, Blenheim, Dargaville,
Devonport, Hawera, Howick, Huntly, Inglewood, Kaiapoi, Kaikohe,
Kaitaia, Martinborough, Mataura, Nelson Institute, Otaki, Palmerston,
Rangiora, Taumarunui, Upper Hutt, Waiuku, Warkworth, and a field
librarian from the Country Library Service, Hamilton.</p>

<p>In addition to lectures and practical exercises, several hours were set
aside for the informal discussion of problems and special questions raised
by the students. Senior members of National Library Service headquarters
joined the staff of the school in these discussions.</p>

<p>Limits imposed by the size of the school made it necessary to defer
acceptance of some students eligible for this course.</p>

<p>A short course on similar lines will be offered again in August this
year to librarians or library assistants of small public libraries who are
not able to take advantage of other means of training.</p>

<p>As in previous years we wish to acknowledge the valuable contribution
made to these courses by visiting lecturers and the libraries which lend
us books.</p>

<p>The National Library Centre, in addition to acting as the division
responsible for the headquarters work of the Service, has continued to
promote the cooperative use of library resources. Staff at headquarters<a class="page" name="Page_15" id ="Page_15" title="15"></a>
are still working under very difficult conditions and there is a continuing
and pressing need both for administrative working space and adequate
housing for the book collections.</p>

<p><i><a name="Inter-library_Loan" id="Inter-library_Loan"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Inter-library Loan</a></i>&mdash;All inter-library loan requests for books and
periodicals the location of which is not known are sent to the National
Centre. Items which are not found in the Union Catalogue of non-fiction
books, the <i>Union List of Serials</i>, or other bibliographical sources
are listed in the weekly publication <i>Book Resources</i>, which is sent to 39
libraries for checking.</p>

<p>Four hundred and seventy-five titles not found in any library were
ordered for national stock.</p>

<p>The number of requests received by the centre represents probably
less than half the total volume of traffic among New Zealand libraries,
the proportion of direct interloan being higher in the special and
university libraries. Interloan was devised and introduced among libraries
by the New Zealand Library Association and in its operation the
responsibility of the National Library Service is not merely to act as
a clearing house but to provide all the material it reasonably can to
make the system effective. Other libraries participate reciprocally, or
lend so that they may the more freely borrow. The contribution, as has
always been expected, is a varying one and one or two libraries may
consider that they have a substantial and unrealisable credit balance in
their favour. The point beyond which certain libraries may feel they
cannot go in the common interest has not so far been determined
administratively but it may be necessary to consider this. If so, it is
better that it be done quantitatively on the basis of a common library
policy rather than that the present procedure should become an
embarrassment or be administered capriciously or conservatively.</p>

<p><i><a name="Central_Bureau_for_Library_Book_Imports" id="Central_Bureau_for_Library_Book_Imports"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Central Bureau for Library Book Imports</a></i>&mdash;After the introduction of
import control in January the Government approved that the facilities
of the bureau should be extended to meet the situation and assure
libraries of their essential supplies. The bureau was set up in 1940
as a responsibility of the Country Library Service as a result of discussions
between the Government and the Library Association. Because
libraries undertook to avoid unnecessary duplication and develop cooperative
ways of recording and using their holdings, the 50 per cent
cut in book imports made in 1939 was restored and the necessary
machinery established to safeguard the country's supply of essential
publications.</p>

<p>The situation now is that recommendations for licences are made to the
Comptroller of Customs in two categories: firstly, block licence in annual<a class="page" name="Page_16" id ="Page_16" title="16"></a>
or six-monthly lots to cover a full licensing period, on behalf of public
libraries serving a population of 20,000 and over, university libraries, and
a few special libraries; secondly, individual recommendations on behalf
of smaller libraries which are made on the basis of orders sent in when
making application. Book-sellers are expected to give libraries a proportionate
share of their 1956 transactions on which their current licence
would be computed.</p>

<p>Block licence recommendations, normally made at the end of the
year&mdash;and for some years only for anticipated imports from scheduled
countries, chiefly the dollar area&mdash;were held over until the present
calendar year and statistically will be included in the figures for the
1958 licensing period.</p>

<p><i><a name="Libraries_of_Government_Departments" id="Libraries_of_Government_Departments"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Libraries of Government Departments</a></i>&mdash;A total of &pound;45,357 was spent
on behalf of Government Departments financed from the Consolidated
Fund and purchasing through the National Library Service. Of this
total, &pound;25,344 was for standing orders, chiefly periodical subscriptions.
The value, nationally, of a range of periodicals wider than that which
is now received by all the libraries would scarcely be disputed, but the
degree of duplication between and particularly within Departments
continues to cause concern.</p>

<p><i><a name="Book_Resources_Committee_of_the_New_Zealand_Library_Association" id="Book_Resources_Committee_of_the_New_Zealand_Library_Association"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Book Resources Committee of the New Zealand Library Association</a></i>&mdash;The
Book Resources Committee of which the Librarian, National Centre,
is Secretary, has continued to act as the national planning and advisory
body in the cooperative acquisition, recording, and use of publications.
In June and July of this year Dr K. D. Metcalf, Librarian Emeritus of
Harvard, at the joint invitation of the United States Educational Foundation
in New Zealand and the New Zealand Government, will visit New
Zealand. Dr Metcalf will visit the main centres and will have discussions
with the committee and the Government on policy matters.</p>

<p><i><a name="Union_Catalogue" id="Union_Catalogue"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Union Catalogue</a></i>&mdash;During the year 26,033 new titles were added
including 2,928 from the microfilmed record of library catalogues. The

<p><i>Union List of Serials</i>&mdash;The typing and printing of the sixth (cumulative)
supplement to the <i>Union List of Serials</i> has commenced and
publication is anticipated early in 1959.</p>

<p><i>Index to New Zealand Periodicals</i>&mdash;The 1956 issue of the index, the
first for which the National Library Service has accepted the responsibility
of publication, was printed by photo-offset and distributed.
The 1957 issue is being prepared in the same way. The possibility of
simplifying production by printing direct from the typed cards is being
explored.</p>

<p><i>General</i>&mdash;Printed catalogue cards for 247 New Zealand books and
pamphlets were issued during the year. Work on the national bibliography,
from 1890 to 1950, has continued and it is hoped to commence
the typing of a preliminary check list of holdings at the end of the year.</p>

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
